# HLS_PARALLEL_MEMCPY EXAMPLE

* Provides an example to show how read(write) data in parallel from(to) HOST memory using memcpy.
* To maximixe memcpy performance, data is written in 4KB chunks (MAX_BURST size) to maximize bandwidth.
* Data is stored in two internal buffers : one for reading and one for writting. Bewteen each operation,
buffers are swapped in order to observe ping pong exchanges between the HOST and the FPGA for behavior checking
* Bandwidth measurements can be done using this example (but internal memory copy performed on FPGA is included in the measurements)

**Warning:** Due to FPGA internal memory limitations, vector_size cannot be higher than 131072 (which corresponds to 1MB buffers).

## Architecture overview

Buffers are arrays of uin32_t and their sizes are defined at runtime with `vector_size` parameter. Read/write process can be repeted multiple time and this value can be set at runtime using `max_iteration` parameter.

## Bandwidth measurements

|Action version| Vector size (uint32_t)| Num Iterations | Total data transfer (bytes)* | Average iteration time (us) | Throughput |
| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------- |
|  0001        | 1024                  | 10000          |  4096 x 2                   |           4.8               |  1.6 GB/s  |
|  0001        | 131072                | 10000          |  524288 x 2                 |           277               |  3.5 GB/s  |

\* size in bytes = vector size * sizeof(uint32_t) and x2 is because we consider bidirectional data transferts.
