# HLS_HELLOWORLD EXAMPLE

* Provides a simple base allowing to discover SNAP
* C code is changing characters case of a user phrase
  * code can be executed on the CPU (will transform all characters to lower case)
  * code can be simulated (will transform all characters to upper case in simulation)
  * code can then run in hardware when the FPGA is programmed (will transform all characters to upper case in hardware)
* The example code uses the copy mechanism to get/put the file from/to system host memory to/from DDR FPGA attached memory
