/**
 * During the workshop we discovered that there are two potential
 * application use-cases:
 *  1. Job-execution mode
 *  2. Data-streaming mode with fixed compute kernel assignment
 *
 * 1. Job-execution mode
 *
 * The first one, which we originally proposed
 * is very similar to what we did with CAPI gzip. It uses AFU directed
 * CAPI mode to allow different processes to attach to the card.
 * A job-queue with a request and a completion part is attached to
 * each AFU context. The cards job-manager schedules jobs, which are
 * executed by the next free kernel.
 *
 * This model supports multi-threaded and multi-process applications by
 * offering best hardware utilization due to the build in job scheduling
 * mechanism.
 *
 * When using this mode ,some design assumptions are imposed on the
 * compute kernels:
 *  - Software sets up jobs and the job-manager hardware takes care
 *    to execute them on the next free kernel
 *  - Software does not do MMIOs to the kernel directly, since kernels
 *    are assigned dynamically by the job-manager
 *  - Kernels must not have state, state can be in host DRAM or on card
 *    DRAM
 *  - Interrupt is used to signal job completion, kernels do not send
 *    interrupts while they are running
 *
 * 2. Fixed compute action assignment/data-streaming mode
 *
 * In this mode compute kernels do not execute one job and can be
 * reused after that. Instead they run for the whole application lifetime.
 * An example is a video processing application, looking for a specific
 * pattern e.g. a person with a baguette. In this mode a kernel can
 * be assigned to an AFU context, and can be started and stopped. MMIO
 * and interrupts are possible during runtime to allow communication
 * with the kernel.
 *
 * A data send and receive queue could be a useful extension.
 *
 * Since the kernels are assigned fixed, multiprocessing is restricted
 * to the available number of compute kernels.

 * }
 *
 * I like the idea to separate queue specifics from the real workitem/job
 * related data. I think that helps to avoid mixing those things up
 * and therefore improves the design. One could even
 * embedd struct snap_job in the AFU specific structure to keep the
 * data together e.g. if dynamic allocation/deallocation is desired.
 *
 * Each AFU.action has to define its own special workitem structure.
 * We can help the AFU to do data prefetching/mapping, if we start
 * the workitem structure with an architected address list. The list
 * ends when flags & SNAP_TARGET_FLAGS_END is not 0.
 *
 * AFU.action specific data can follow. I think the AFU.action
 * itself will know how large the data must be. For compression that
 * was for example compression-window data, position in data stream,
 * not fully written symbols or data which did not fit into the
 * provided too small output buffer, etc. Versioning, or size hints,
 * maybe ...
 *

 *
 * struct flash_job {
 *        struct snap_addr src;        // just one for this application,
 *        struct snap_addr dst;        // could be more if needed

 *        uint64_t special_state;
 *        uint64_t special_errcode;
 *                                // to keep allocation simple
 * };
 *
 * struct flash_job fjob;
 * struct snap_job cjob;
 *
 * fjob.src = { .addr = 0x234234000, size = 4096, .type = SNAP_TYPE_DRAM,
 *                .flags = SNAP_TARGET_FLAGS_ADDR };
