# Build environment

In order to set up the required environment variables for a given `FRAMEWORK_ROOT`, you may source the script [./snap_settings](./snap_settings):

```bash
    . ./snap_settings
```

The following commands need to be executed before calling this script:

```
    export FRAMEWORK_ROOT       = <your local workspace base>
    source <xilinx_root>/Vivado/<version>/settings64.sh
    export XILINXD_LICENSE_FILE = <pointer to Xilinx license>
```

This script will define the following environment variables (if they are not already pre-defined
differently):

```
    FPGACARD            = KU3                                                    # CAPI FPGA card to be used - currently supported are KU3, FGT
    FPGACHIP            = xcku060-ffva1156-2-e                                   # version of the FPGA chip
    SNAP_ROOT           = <parent of the directory containing snap_settings>     # snap clone from github
    PSLSE_ROOT          = <parent of the $SNAP_ROOT directory>                   # PSLSE clone from github
    PSL_DCP             =                                                        # PSL DCP for the CAPI FPGA card
    SIMULATOR           = xsim                                                   # currently supported simulators are xsim, irun (IES)
    NUM_OF_ACTIONS      = 1                                                      # number of actions to be implemented with the card (up to 16)
    SDRAM_USED          = FALSE                                                  # if set to TRUE the actions have access to the on card SDRAM via an AXI interface
```

### Cadence setup

If you want to use Cadence tools (i.e. ncsim or irun) for simulation you need to compile the Xilinx IP and let the environment variable

```
   export IES_LIBS      = <pointer to precompiled Xilinx IP for Cadence tools>
   export CDS_LIC_FILE  = <pointer to Cadence license>
```

point to the resulting compiled library.

Furthermore, the environment variables `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` need to contain the paths
to the Cadence tools and libraries. In case `SIMULATOR=ncsim` or `SIMULATOR=irun` the script
[./snap_settings](./snap_settings) will set the Cadence specific environment variable

```
   CDS_INST_DIR         = <Cadence Installation Directory>                       # path to Cadence installation
```

if it is not already pre-defined.


# Action wrapper

The path to the set of actions that shall be included is defined via the environment variable `ACTION_ROOT`.
**Currently it has to point to a directory within** [./action_examples](./action_examples).

This directory needs to contain an entity named `action_wrapper` as interface between the actions and the SNAP framework.

Corresponding to the ports that the SNAP framework provides
* an AXI master port for MMIO based control
* an AXI slave port for host DMA traffic
* an optional AXI slave port for on card DDR3 RAM traffic

the port map of the `action_wrapper` has to consist of the correspondig counterparts.
Note that the ID widths of the AXI interfaces to host memory and to the on card DRAM have to be
large enough to support the number of actions that shall be instantiated.
For the build process this is controlled via the environment variable `NUM_OF_ACTIONS`
which defaults to `1` if not set differently.

An example for an action together with a corresponding wrapper may be found
in [./action_examples/hdl_example](./action_examples/hdl_example).

### HDL Action
The example contained in the [hdl_example](./action_examples/hdl_example) directory shows how to write an action in VHDL. It can be used for various verification scenarios like moving memory content.

### HLS Actions
You'll also find examples for HLS actions in [./action_examples](./action_examples). For each example, the HLS action to be integrated into the SNAP framework is contained in a file `hls_<action>.cpp`. Before initiating the SNAP framework's make process, you need to create the necessary RTL files (VHDL) out of the `hls_<action>.cpp` file. Each example contains a `Makefile` that takes care of this. In order to make sure that the resulting top level entity fits into the SNAP framework, the HLS actions top level function needs to be named `hls_action`. All RTL files generated by the example's make process will be placed into a subdirectory `vhdl`. The environment variable `$ACTION_ROOT` needs to point to that directory when initiating the SNAP framework's make process. 

***Note*** that for the integration of HLS actions into the SNAP framework, the `$ACTION_ROOT` directory name needs to contain the term `HLS` (case doesn't matter), or the environment variable `$HLS_SUPPORT` needs to be defined and to be set to `TRUE` (case doesn't matter).

# DRAM Card Memory

The SNAP framework supports the usage of the on-card DRAM. It is accessible for the actions via the action wrapper
through an AXI master interface. The existence of that interface is configurable via the environment variable `SDRAM_USED`.
When setting

```bash
    SDRAM_USED=TRUE
```

the interface will be instantiated and the access to the SDRAM will be provided.


# Image and model build

In order to prepare the vivado environment for this project, call:

```bash
    make config
```

from within `$SNAP_HARDWARE_ROOT`. Pre-requisite for this is that the environment variables for this project
are defined (e.g. by sourcing the [./snap_settings](./snap_settings) script).
The variable `SIMULATOR` is used to determine for which of the simulators xsim or ncsim
the environment will be prepared.

If the variable `ACTION_ROOT` is not set the make process will terminate. 
The VHDL based default action example will be included if the environment variable is set to
`$SNAP_HARDWARE_ROOT/action_examples/hdl_example`.
As usual you may set the variable with the call of make:

```bash
    make config ACTION_ROOT=$SNAP_HARDWARE_ROOT/action_examples/memcopy
```

As part of the configuration step, a script `$ACTION_ROOT/action_config.sh` will be called if it exists.
Specific configurations/preparations for the action may be added via this script.

If you call make w/o any targets, then the environment is created and a simulation model build
as well as a card image build are kicked off.
In order to build a model and an image including the memcopy action example, call:

```bash
    make ACTION_ROOT=$SNAP_HARDWARE_ROOT/action_examples/memcopy
```

If you want to build an image (a bitstream) for a given `ACTION_ROOT`, you may call make with target image:

```bash
    make config image
```

Note: All preparations for the build process, including the decision which actions get included, are made in the configuration step.
If the configuration step was already executed, you may just call:

```bash
    make image
```

A simulation model (for the simulator defined by the environment variable `SIMULATOR`) may be created
via the target model:

```bash
    make config model
```

Please refer to `$SNAP_HARDWARE_ROOT/Makefile` for more supported targets like clean, gitclean, create_environment, copy, ...

# Simulation

You may kick off simulation from within the subdirectory sim using the script run_sim.
For the VHDL based example (`ACTION_ROOT=$SNAP_HARDWARE_ROOT/action_examples/hdl_example`) call:

```bash
    ./run_sim -app tools/stage2 -a2          # -a2 option passed to application by default
    ./run_sim -app tools/stage2 -a2 -t title # -t is a simulator option
    ./run_sim -app tools/stage2 -arg "-t"    # force argument being passed to application
```
