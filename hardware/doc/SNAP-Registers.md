## MMIO-MAP - Master Space
While the master context has access to the whole MMIO space the first 32MB
of the MMIO space are accessible by the master exclusively (with s = 512 this
is corresponding to the address range below s * 0x0010000).
The Framework Control and Status registers (aka Master PSA registers) are 8B
registers. All the other registers are 4B wide.

## MMIO-MAP Slave Context
Each slave context has access to its own 64KB MMIO space only via the address offset.
PSL is adding the base address which is (s+n)*0x0010000 where s is 512 and n is the
context id. The MMIO space of the action attached to the context is mapped into the
last 4KB of the slave context space.
The Framework Control and Status registers (aka Slave PSA) are 8B registers.
The action's registers are 4B wide.

The master context has access to each slave context space.

Address map for context n (0 <= n < 512), and with s = 512:

```

## SNAP Framework Register Specifications

RW  = Read/Write  
RO  = Read only - Reserved bits return 0 unless specified otherwise  
RC  = Read only with clear on read  
RWC = Read/WriteClear (Write clears (=>0) the bits for each bit=1 in the write value)  
RWS = Read/WriteSet   (Write sets (=>1) the bits for each bit=1 in the write value)

n = Context Handle (aka. Process ID; 0 <= n < number of processes)

## MMIO-Map Action Space
Each action has a 4KB MMIO space which can be accessed from a master context or
from a slave context using the address ranges as described in the respective
MMIO-Map above.

The following MMIO registers have dedicated meanings within the SNAP framework.  
When the Action gets created using Xilinx HLS the registers marked as "Reserved"
are required for HLS control information. Otherwise, they may be used for any purpose.

## PSL Registers
Taken from PSL spec

#### PSL Slice Error Register (PSL_SErr_An)
n = 0,1,2,3
```
Address: BAR2 + 0x010028 + n * 0x000100
      63 RWC: AFU MMIO Timeout (afuto). Enabled Accelerator did not respond to MMIO operation (mmio_afuto_err).
                The hang pulse frequency must be configured in PSL_DSNDCTL[mmiohp] for the hang to be
                detected. A read operation returns Zeroes. The MMIO address is saved in PSL_AFU_DEBUG_A.
                This bit is cleared by writing a '1'.
      62 RWC: MMIO targeted Accelerator that was not enabled (afudis). (mmio_dis_err) A write operation is ignored. A
                read operation returns data of 'DEADB00FDEADB00F' when PSL_RXCTL_An[deadb00f]=1 or all
                ones when PSL_RXCTL_An[deadb00f]=0.The MMIO address is saved in PSL_AFU_DEBUG_A.
                This bit is cleared by writing a '1'.
      61 RWC: AFU CTAG Overflow (afuov). Accelerator issued more than 64 outstanding CMD requests (rx_jm_sf_error(0)).
                Request is ignored and there are no ill effects to PSL.
                This bit is cleared by writing a '1'.
      60 RWC: Bad Interrupt Source (badsrc). In AFU Directed Mode only, Accelerator issued an interrupt request with an
                unsupported interrupt source. The interrupt source did not fit into any enabled and defined ranges in
                the PSL_IVTE_LIMIT_An. The request received a 'failed' response so this notification is redundant
                and should be masked.
                In other modes this bit is reserved.
                This bit is cleared by writing a '1'.
      59 RWC: Bad Context Handle (badctx). In AFU_Directed Mode only, the accelerator issued a request using a bad
                context handle. (The retrieved SWSTATE is not valid , PSL_SPAP[V]=0). The request received a
                context response so this notification is redundant and should be masked.
                In other modes this bit is reserved.
      58 RWC: LLCMD to Disabled AFU (llcmddis). in AFU Directed Mode, SW updated the PSl_LLCMD_An register when
                the AFU was not enabled. This may not be an error and should be MASKED if expected. The
                LLCMD is forwarded to the translation logic which will indicate an 'error' completion status in the
                Software command/status field in the scheduled process area.In other modes, this bit is reserved.
                This bit is cleared by writing a '1'.
      57 RWC: LLCMD Timeout to AFU (llcmdto). In AFU Directed Mode only, the AFU did not assert ah_jcack on the afu
                control interface in response to a LLCMD within the timeout period. The hang pulse frequency must
                be configured in PSL_RXCTL_An[afuhp] for the hang to be detected. The LLCMD is forwarded to
                the Translation Logic which will indicate an 'error' completion status in the Software command/status
                field in the scheduled process area. This notification is redundant and should be masked.
                In other modes, this bit is reserved.
                This error should be MASKED in production.
                This bit is clerared by writing a '1'.
      56 RWC: AFU MMIO Parity Error (afupar). A MMIO read of an AFU register contained bad parity. The read operation
                returns data of DEADB00FDEADB00F when PSL_RXCTL_An[deadb00f]=1 or all ones when
                PSL_RXCTL_An[deadb00f]=0. The MMIO address is saved in PSL_AFU_DEBUG_A.
                This bit is cleared by writing a '1'.
      55 RWC: AFU Duplicate CTAG Error (afudup). The accelerator issue a CMD with a CTAG that is already in use. The
                request is accepted but the PSL queues have been corrupted and requests may be lost. The PSL
                requires a reload and may start setting FIR1/2 bits.
  64..48 RWC: Reserved for Implementation Specific Errors
  47..34 RWC: Reserved for CAIA Defined Errors
      33 RWC: AFU Error (AE). AFU asserted JDONE with JERROR in AFU Directed Mode. JERROR information is captured in
                the AFU_ERROR_An register. This error is asserted in the DSISR_An when in other modes.
      32 RWC: (HC). Not GA1. PSL_CtxTime[Warn_Hypervisor] timer interval expires
      31 RWC: (afuto_mask).    Set by system software to disable reporting of afuto interrupt.
      30 RWC: (afudis_mask).   Set by system software to disable reporting of afudis interrupt.
