# Generate HDL version of the HLS sources
#
# The generated HDL depends on the chip which is used and
# therefore must match what is being used to build the
# toplevel SNAP bitstream.
#
# FIXME Pass part_number and other parameters from toplevel
#      build-system as required.
#

# This is solution specific. Check if we can replace this by generics too.
