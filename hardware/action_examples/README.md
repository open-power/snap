### SNAP Action Examples

In this subdirectory there are a number of SNAP hardware action examples. There is one HDL based example and multiple HLS written ones. Note that the HLS examples should be in directories prefixed with `hls_*`. This will automatically trigger the HDL synthesis step during the image build process.

The HLS examples can use common definitions in [include/hls_snap.H](./include/hls_snap.H) and should share SNAP job descriptions by including the `action_*.h` header files stored in the [software/examples](../../software/examples) directory. Those job descriptions must only include `snap_types.h`, such that only those definitions are shared, which are really used.

### SNAP Action Registration

To uniquely identfiy SNAP actions, they must use a uniqe id. How to setup the id is described in [ActionTypes.md](../../ActionTypes.md).

### SNAP Action Enumeration

To enable SNAP actions, please use the *snap_maint* application prior to using the individual SNAP host-application. It is sufficient to execute this step once (before using the FPGA for the first time).

### Xilinx HLS Testbench

To configure the include path for the common header files with the Xilinx Vivado HLS GUI, set *-DNO_SYNTH -I../include -I../../../software/include -I../../../software/examples* in *Project->Project Settings-> Simulation->Edit CFLAGS* attached to the `hls_action.cpp` file.
