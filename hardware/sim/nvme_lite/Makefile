# FIXME We might like to generate a full snap_config.sv at a global place
#      for all SystemVerilog/Verilog sources, such that we can use that
#      to feed the Verilog preprocessor. I tried my luck with cpp but that
#      had trouble with simple 's where the processing stopped demanding
#      a closing '.
