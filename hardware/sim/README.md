# Building a model
see [../README.md](../README.md) for further instructions
Note: The Makefile for building a model calls Vivado to export a script `top.sh` for compile & elaborate & simulate.
By default this already calls the simulator. In SNAP the simulator execution is disabled and replaced by [./run_sim](./run_sim).  
Cadence also supports a three-step compile/elab/run mode, which lists compile modules differently and is not used for SNAP.
The Cadence one-step irun mode calls irun for compile and for simulator execution, the simulator underneath is called ncsim.  
Xilinx builds models in three steps compile/elaborate/simulate with a `.prj` file similar to Cadence irun

## compile options
```
            Cadence          Xilinx
all         -64bit           -m64
            -relax           --relax
compile     -v93
elaborate   -access +rwc
            -namemap_mixgen
                             --debug typical
                             --mt auto
simulate                     -tclbatch cmd.tcl
logfile                      --log simulate.log
```

# Running a simulation model
The simulation script `run_sim` is called from $SNAP_ROOT/hardware/sim.
The environment variable `SIMULATOR` selects the simulator and can be set to `xsim` or to `irun`.  
`run_sim` will
* start the simulator (irun, xsim) and wait for it to open an IP socket
* start PSLSE and wait for it to connect to this socket and open a second IP socket
* start an application (or list of applications or xwindow, where you can start any app)

When the app or list or xwindow finishes, this is the signal for PSLSE and the simulator to also end and close all logfiles.
This means, that PSLSE&sim only runs, as long as the app/list/xterm is avail.
If you start an app in the xterm and cntl-C it without exiting from the xterm, the simulation keeps running.  
Or start `run_sim -app <application>` to run just this one app  
or start `run_sim -list <list.sh>` to run a list of testcases, before ending.

* output generated in           $SNAP_ROOT/hardware/sim/xsim/<yyyymmdd_hhmmss>

# Debugging a model
## waveform generation
Calling `run_sim` with -aet (waveforms enabled, this is the default) starts a tcl script to include signals.
```
 ncaet.tcl                           # for Cadence irun
 xsaet.tcl                           # for Xilinx xsim
```
The generated waveform can be viewed with
```
 simvision capiWave.shm              # for Cadence waveforms
 simvision capiWave.shm -snapshot xx # with snapshot to get access to design hierarchy
 iccr -gui                           # view interactive coverage

 xsim top.wdb -gui                   # for Xilinx waveforms
```

## controlling PSLSE randomness
By default the PSLSE environment reorders and delays commands/responses in order to get more variations.
```
 TIMEOUT:10                          # Timeout delay in seconds: If 0 then timeouts are disabled.
 CREDITS:64                          # number of credits provided
 SEED:13                             # Randomization seed.  Set this to force reproducible sequence of event
 RESPONSE_PERCENT:10,20              # Percentage chance of PSL driving any pending responses in a clock cycle. used for reordering cmds
 PAGED_PERCENT:2,4                   # Percentage chance of PSL responding with PAGED for any command response.
 REORDER_PERCENT:80,90               # Percentage chance of PSL reordering the execution of commands.
 BUFFER_PERCENT:80,90                # Percentage chance of PSL generating extra buffer read/write activity.
```
For recreation of a dedicated problem you can disable this variation with your own parms file
```
 RESPONSE_PERCENT:100,100            # Percentage chance of PSL driving any pending responses in a clock cycle. used for reordering cmds
 PAGED_PERCENT:0,0                   # Percentage chance of PSL responding with PAGED for any command response.
 REORDER_PERCENT:0,0                 # Percentage chance of PSL reordering the execution of commands.
 BUFFER_PERCENT:0,0                  # Percentage chance of PSL generating extra buffer read/write activity.
```
